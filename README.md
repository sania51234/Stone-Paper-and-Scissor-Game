# Stone, Paper, Scissor Game

This is a simple Python-based implementation of the classic **Stone, Paper, Scissor** game. The user plays against the computer, with each round consisting of one choice from the player and the computer making a random choice. The game announces the result of each round and can be played multiple times.

## How the Game Works

- **Stone beats Scissor**
- **Scissor beats Paper**
- **Paper beats Stone**

### How to Play

1. The user is prompted to enter their choice: 
   - **St** for Stone
   - **P** for Paper
   - **S** for Scissor

2. The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3. The game compares the player's choice with the computer's choice and determines the result (win, lose, or draw).
4. The result is printed to the screen.

### Features

- The game is interactive and can be played in the terminal.
- Tracks and displays results for each round.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the game file.
3. Run the following command:
